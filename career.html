    <p>My journey in the hairdressing industry began in 2014, when I started studying and working at the prestigious corporate salon, Gary Rom. Through dedication, hard work, and a passion for the craft, I quickly rose through the ranksâ€”achieving the highest stylist level within four years and being promoted to Salon Manager in my fifth year. During this time, I discovered and honed my specialized skills in extensions and colour, which have since become my signature services.</p>
    <p>Building on this foundation, I took a bold step and opened my own salon, where I continue to express my creativity and deliver exceptional results to my clients. Alongside managing my salon, Iâ€™ve also had the privilege of working as a freelance representative for Schwarzkopfâ€”a brand that played a significant role in shaping me into the stylist I am today. Through this partnership, I not only work with their professional products but also help educate and inspire other stylists across South Africa.</p>

          <h2>Consultation</h2>
          <p>Scalp analysist, Protein and Moisture analysist, likes and dislikes, Homecare routine, cool or warm skin tone, facial shapes. All thing that should be ask be any stylist your go to. A proper consultation is the foundation of every great hairstyleâ€”and it all begins with the condition of your hair and scalp. Healthy hair is non-negotiable. Even the most talented, world-renowned stylist cannot achieve 10/10 results if your hair is sitting at a 1/10 in health. That's why I prioritize an honest assessment of your hair and scalp before any service. Strong, well-nourished hair not only holds color better but lasts longer and is much easier to manage. Itâ€™s not just about what you wantâ€”it's about what your hair can safely handle. And that starts at the rootâ€”literally.</p>

          <h2>Colour Specialist</h2>
          <p>As a colour master, I approach each appointment like an engineer excited to solve a complex equation. Every head of hair presents a new challengeâ€”and I thrive on decoding it. From understanding developer strengths to the role of colour molecules and the nuances of chemical reactions, I use precision and creativity to craft flawless results. My expertise in colour theory allows me to create dimensional blondes, rich chocolate browns, and soft, seamless balayages that are both beautiful and low-maintenance. Your hair goals are unique, and I love the challenge of bringing them to life with skill and science.</p>

        <div class="career-card">
          <h2>Extensions</h2>
          <p>Extensions arenâ€™t just for adding lengthâ€”theyâ€™re a solution to some of the most common hair struggles my clients face. Whether you're craving thicker hair, longing for volume, struggling with hair that wonâ€™t grow, or want a colour change without the commitment or damage, extensions offer instant gratification. From wefts and tapes to keratin bonds, micro rings, and nano bonds, thereâ€™s an option for everyone. Theyâ€™re not a luxuryâ€”theyâ€™re a tool that should be part of more conversations in the salon. Extensions empower you to experience the hair youâ€™ve always wantedâ€”without waiting months or compromising your hairâ€™s health.</p>

        <div class="career-card">
          <h2>Homecare</h2>
          <p>What you do at home matters just as much as what we do in the salon. Homecare is the secret to maintaining healthy, beautiful hair between appointments. Using the right combination of protein for strength and moisture for elasticity is key to preventing breakage and promoting softness and shine. It's not about using expensive productsâ€”itâ€™s about using the right products for your hair. Iâ€™ll guide you through what your hair truly needs, so youâ€™re not guessing in the shampoo aisle. With the right routine, youâ€™ll not only extend your resultsâ€”youâ€™ll love your hair every single day.</p>

    <p> We did a reverse balayage â€” which, for those unfamiliar, is a hair coloring technique where color is hand-painted onto the hair to create a soft, natural-looking gradient, usually going lighter toward the ends. In this case, we flipped the script: she had become too blonde and wanted to walk out of the salon as a seamless brunette. By adding depth and dimension back into her hair with deeper tones, we achieved a natural, blended result that still had movement and richness. I also shared some styling tips with her, including how to use Velcro rollers during her blow-dry routine to create maximum volume, and how to add some soft curls to enhance the final look.</p>
